# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management



**This is a simple JavaScript project that contains a class called "BankBranch". The class has a constructor that takes in a "branchInfo" object, which contains information about a bank branch. The class also has a method called "getBranchInfo()" that returns the "branchInfo" object.

The project also contains a usage section that shows how to create two "BankBranch" instances and log their "branchInfo" properties.**

A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.
